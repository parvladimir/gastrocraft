Official company website for **GastroCraft**, a premium digital solutions partner for restaurants.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer
- npm 10 or newer

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server starts at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Production Deployment

### Vercel

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Import `parvladimir/gastrocraft` into Vercel.
3. Use the `Next.js` framework preset.
4. Use the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

5. Add the environment variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL
```

6. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to the final public URL.
7. Redeploy after adding or changing a custom domain.
8. Verify:
   - `/sitemap.xml`
   - `/robots.txt`
   - `/manifest.webmanifest`
   - `/opengraph-image`
   - `/twitter-image`

Do not configure a production domain in the repository until the final public
domain has been confirmed.

### Generic Node Hosting

The production server build requires a Node.js-capable hosting environment.

Requirements:

- Node.js 22 or newer
- npm 10 or newer

Deployment commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

A normal PHP-only shared hosting package cannot run this Next.js server build
unless it explicitly supports Node.js applications.
